		\question
		There are 1000 seats in a theatre. The theatre has two entrances, each of them having its own cloakroom.  How many places should each cloakroom have in order that each of the visitors can give his or her coat to the cloakroom near the entrance where they came in. Please use the $99\%$ confidence interval. Consider the following situations:
		\begin{parts}
			\part the visitors come in pairs, and each of the pairs chooses one of the entrances at random;
